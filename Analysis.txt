Worst Case Time Complexity Analysis

Task 0: Worst Case Complexity: O(1)
This task involves no loops at all, there is no change to the run time that is dependent on the input, so this worst case scenario is O(1)

Task 1: Worst Case Complexity: O(n)
The solution for this task includes two for loops meaning that the complexity is dependent on the size of the input, so the worst case scenario is O(n) 

Task 2: Worst Case Complexity: O(n)
The solution for this task includes one for loop, meaning that the complexity is dependent on the size of the input, so the worst case scenario is O(n) 

Task 3: Worst Case Complexity: O(n log(n))
Sorted was used in completing this task, so this code's worst case scenario is like that of sorted, with a time complexity of O(n log(n))

Task 4: Worst Case Complexity: O(n log(n))
Sorted was used in completing this task, so this code's worst case scenario is like that of sorted, with a time complexity of O(n log(n))
